Barcode Scanning Utility
This scanner utility utilizes pyserial and pynput to automate an inventory data entry process via barcode scanning. The utility iterates over open COM Ports to match to a specific scanner description, then assigns that port using pyserial. Pynput uses keyboard shortcuts and enters barcode data.
